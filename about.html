    <h1>About Angel Cosmetics</h1>
    <p>

      ingredients that help you feel confident inside and out. Our mission is to provide clean, 
      simple formulas that support glowing skin and effortless self-care for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our brand brgan as a small, independently run project, where products were hand-made in limited
      batches and shared with friends and family. After receiving positive feedback, we decided to expand
      into an established beauty line.
    </p>
    <p>Today, we operate as a growing team, but our approach hasn't changed. We continue to create products loved by many, while still
    keeping them affordable.</p>
